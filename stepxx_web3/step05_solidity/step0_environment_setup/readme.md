# Solidity Environment Setup

This repository provides a step-by-step guide to help you set up your environment to start programming smart contracts in Solidity.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 10.x or later)
- npm (version 5.x or later)
- Ganache (a personal blockchain for Ethereum development)
- A code editor of your choice (such as Visual Studio Code)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository using git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
2. Install the required dependencies by running npm install
3. Install Truffle using npm install -g truffle
4. Install the Solidity compiler using npm install -g solc
5. Install the MetaMask extension for your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, Brave)
6. Open Ganache and create a new workspace
7. Connect your code editor to Ganache by setting up a new workspace in your code editor and providing the correct settings (network name, RPC server URL, and chain ID)
8. You're ready to start coding!

## Usage

To compile your Solidity code, run truffle compile. To deploy your contracts to the blockchain, run truffle migrate. To interact with your deployed contracts, use Truffle's console by running truffle console.
