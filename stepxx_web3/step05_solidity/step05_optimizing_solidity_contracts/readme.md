## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your machine:

1. Node.js (version 12 or higher)
2. Hardhat (version 2 or higher)

You can install Hardhat using npm by running the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

## Step 1: Set up the project

Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it. Then, initialize a new Hardhat project by running the following command:

```bash
npx hardhat init
```

This will create a new Hardhat project with some basic files and directories.

## Step 2: Write your Solidity contract

In the `contracts/` directory, create a new Solidity file and write your contract. For example, you can create a simple contract that adds two numbers:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

contract Calculator {
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) external pure returns (uint256) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

Save the file as `Calculator.sol`.

## Step 3: Configure the optimizer

Open the `hardhat.config.js` file and configure the Solidity optimizer. For example, you can set the optimizer to run with a high level of optimization:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.0",
    settings: {
      optimizer: {
        enabled: true,
        runs: 200,
      },
    },
  },
};
```

The `enabled` flag enables the optimizer, and the `runs` parameter sets the number of runs the optimizer will perform. The higher the number of runs, the more optimized your contract will be, but it will also take longer to compile.

## Step 4: Compile the contract

To compile the contract with the optimizer enabled, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

This will compile the `Calculator` contract with the optimizer enabled.

## Step 5: Analyze the gas usage

After compiling the contract, Hardhat will output the gas usage of each contract function. This will help you identify which functions are consuming the most gas and can be optimized further.

For example, the following output shows that the `add` function consumes 132 gas:

```
Calculator
  add(uint256,uint256) (pure)
    132 gas
```

## Step 6: Optimize the code

Based on the gas usage analysis, you can optimize the code further by using gas-efficient Solidity constructs, such as `view` and `pure` functions, `constant` variables, and `memory` variables instead of `storage` variables whenever possible.

For example, you can optimize the `Calculator` contract further by making the `add` function a `pure` function:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.9;

contract Calculator {
    function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) external pure returns (uint256) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

The `pure` keyword tells the Solidity compiler that the function does not read or modify the contract state, and it can be executed entirely on the stack. This can result in significant gas savings.

## Step 7: Compile and deploy the optimized contract

After optimizing the contract code, compile it again with the optimizer enabled:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

Then, deploy the optimized contract to the desired network using the deployment script and `npx hardhat run`
